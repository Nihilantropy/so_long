This is the so_long project for the 42 school. Enjoy and try to discover all the secrets!

First of all, every message here is encripted! Try a way to break trough the words, maybe try some folder... idk.

Second! Play the game. Play it, destroy all the enemies and pay attention to the terminal messages, maybe you could detect something...

In case the messages aren't helpfull and you are a real digger, open the code, take a look, see where the breach is.

So, now that you've discovered the secret, it's time to... what? Unlock it? How? READ THE SUBJECT! (not the real one, just read the message).

At this point you should be able to enter, but in case your sight is not that sharp here's an hint: kill all the enemies and smash that pipi on the wall (any wall will work). For how many times? Look the code my friend, or just count... but be fast.

Now the real challenge! Will you be able to destroy your secret enemy (aka. BOB)?
If you are too lazy to fight, try to smash some keyboard button (for the love of god look at the messages, or just take a look at the code).

In any case, listen to the folder's name. If it says 'do not open', why would you open it?

That's really it, a nice project, a funny way to waste some time, a pain in the ass to debug (what debug isn't tho). So i hope this will be a little challenge for you little hole digger. See yaa, and leave a star if you like (˶ᵔ ᵕ ᵔ˶).
